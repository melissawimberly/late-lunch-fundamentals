### What is a Terminal?

## Text Editor

### What is a Text Editor

A text editor is an application on your computer that allows you to open, view, and edit plain text files. Text editors support multiple programming languages and are NOT the same as word processors. Word Processors (such as Microsoft Word) allow for the formatting and styling of presentational text where as text editors focus on code. AKA this is the place where you write your code!

## Version Control

### What is Git?

Git is a command line tool that can be accessed in your Terminal. Git allows developers to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. With Git, developers are able to save each version of the project they are working on so that they can come back to any moment in time of their code base.

### What is Github?

Github is a company that hosts projects, (called repositories) for software development version control using Git. Much like how your computer is controlled by the Terminal, Github is controlled by Git. Github allows developers to view the intricacies of Git in a user friendly way. Github also allows developers around the world to collaborate, view, and share code.
